    <h1>Citizen Code of Conduct</h1>

    <h2> 1. Purpose </h2>

    <p>
      A primary goal of pettycoin is to be inclusive to
      the largest number of contributors, with the most varied
      and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed
      to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
      all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
      ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack
      thereof).
    </p>

    <p>
      This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all
      those who participate in our community, as well as the
      consequences for unacceptable behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      We invite all those who participate in pettycoin to
      help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
    </p>

    <h2> 2.‎ ‏Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship </h2>

    <p>
      A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase
      Free/Open Source Software citizenship by encouraging
      participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships
      between our actions and their effects on our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you see someone who is making an extra effort to
      ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages
      all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we
      want to know.
    </p>

    <h2> 3.‎ ‏Expected Behavior </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
	Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> 4.‎ ‏Unacceptable Behavior </h2>

    <p>
      Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
      discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by
      any participant in our community online.
    </p>

    <p>

      related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
      inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public community
      spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following and unwelcome
      sexual attention.
    </p>

    <h2> 5.‎ ‏Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior </h2>

    <p>
      Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those
      with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to
      comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the
      community organizers may take any action they deem
      appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or
      permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

    <p>
      Additionally, community organizers are available to help
      community members engage with local law enforcement or to
      otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel
      safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will
      also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing
      distress.
    </p>
