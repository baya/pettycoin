      <h1> Pettycoin: Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

      <p class="rawtext">
	Hi!  If you want answers which aren't listed here, you should
	<a href="https://github.com/rustyrussell/pettycoin/issues">ask
	  me</a>.  You're probably not the only one wondering...
      </p>
      
      <h2>Pettycoin vs Bitcoin</h2>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="altcoin"><a href="#altcoin">
	    Is pettycoin an altcoin?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  No.  An altcoin is an alternative currency which copies
	  bitcoin, with some (often trivial) variation, and starts
	  from scratch.  Altcoins have an established path: the
	  creator starts mining, gives away as many as they can in a
	  desperate bid for attention, then sells before the price
	  crashes!  Pettycoin uses real bitcoins, so it can't reward
	  early adopters by giving them away.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="compete"><a href="#compete">
	    Does pettycoin compete with bitcoin?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  No.  Pettycoin is designed to complement bitcoin, and relies
	  on it.  Various bitcoin vendors already perform
	  "off-blockchain" internal transactions to avoid fees and
	  delay.  This takes that model a step further, with an open
	  and relatively decentralized network.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="mergemine"><a href="#mergemine">
	    Can bitcoin miners mergemine pettycoin?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  Yes, but not yet.  See <a href="#todo-protocol">the todo list.</a>
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="sidechain"><a href="#sidechain">
	    Is pettycoin a sidechain?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  No (for now).  Sidechains require a non-trivial modification
	  to the bitcoin protocol to support them; logically that
	  should only happen when it benefits the bitcoin network
	  itself.  That possibility lies in the distant future, so
	  meanwhile we use gateways.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="fees"><a href="#fees">
	    What fees does a pettycoin transaction have?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  The pettycoin fee is fixed at 0.3% of the total bitcoins
	  being used (actually, 3 / 1024 + 1 satoshi), which is
	  slightly less.  But you can mark a transaction as paying no
	  fees, and it's expected that miners will accept these for
	  quite a long time.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="miner-paid"><a href="#miner-paid">
	    How do pettycoin miners get paid?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  Firstly, using standard rewards: a "random" transaction is
	  chosen and the mining reward is simply the fee of this
	  transaction multiplied by the number of transactions in the
	  block.  Statistically, this should be correct.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  Secondly, a share of future rewards will be scattered back
	  to the miners of early blocks.
	  See <a href="#todo-protocol">the todo list.</a>

      <h2> Getting Bitcoins Into and Out of Pettycoin </h2>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="into-pettycoin"><a href="#into-pettycoin">
	    How do I get bitcoin into the pettycoin network?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  If you are using your own coins (not an online wallet),
	  simply send some BTC to the gateway.  It will inject
	  those bits into the pettycoin network at the
	  same <a href="#address">address</a>.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="out-of-pettycoin"><a href="#out-of-pettycoin">
	    How do I get bitcoin off the pettycoin network?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  You can send it to a gateway in a TX_TO_GATEWAY transaction
	  which will remove it from the pettycoin network: the gateway
	  will inject it back into the bitcoin network.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  Otherwise, waiting a month for
	  the <a href="#horizon">horizon</a> to pass will cause the
	  gateway to reinject the now-unusable transaction onto the
	  bitcoin network.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="forgotten-coins"><a href="#forgotten-coins">
	    What happens if I forget my pettycoins?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  They will <a href="#horizon">time out</a> after a month,
	  and a gateway will return them to the same address on
	  the bitcoin network.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="to-bitcoin-user"><a href="#to-bitcoin-user">
	    Can I send bitcoins to a bitcoin user via the pettycoin network?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  Yes!  Simply send them some pettycoins, and if they
	  don't collect them they'll <a href="#horizon">fall
	    out</a> into the bitcoin network.
	</p>
      </div>

      <h2> What Are The Worst Things About Pettycoin? </h2>

      <div class="rawtext">
	<p>
	  This one gets its own section.  I'm sure people who don't read
	  this far will be <em>shocked</em> when they find these out, and rage
	  upon the Internets.

	<div class="boxed">
	  <h4 id="privacy"><a href="#privacy">
	      Horrible privacy properties.
	  </a></h4>
	  <p class="details">
	    The simplified bitcoin transactions are <em>too</em>
	    simple: all inputs and the change go to the same
	    address.  This makes transactions trivial to
	    track: if you pay 10 people it'll be obvious that one
	    person made those ten payments.
	  </p>
	  <p class="details">
	    At a time when the bitcoin network is implementing things
	    like <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0">coinjoin</a>,
	    it's clear that making a network with <em>worse</em> privacy
	    is a bad idea.

	      Trusting the gateways.
	  </a></h4>
	  <p class="details">
	    The gateways are holding your bitcoins: a hack or a
	    corrupt gateway means your coins are gone.  While
	    gateways' operations can be audited and their behavior
	    watched, you are subject to this risk until your coins
	    return to the bitcoin network.
	  </p>
	  <p class="details">
	    For this reason, the initial gateway will only take very
	    small amounts: I don't want to be holding your coins
	    either!

      <h2> The Protocol Details </h2>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="address"><a href="#address">
	    What does an address look like?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  Normal bitcoin addresses have a '1' prefix, like
	  1RustyRX2oai4EYYDpQGWvEL62BBGqN9T.  The pettycoin equivalent
	  is PYMh1yfZH8keWL3PuiUFRYAHaLSzvB2Kd4, but you can use
	  'P-1RustyRX2oai4EYYDpQGWvEL62BBGqN9T' for convenience.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  Technical details: bitcoin binary address use a 0 prefix (or
	  111 for testnet), which encodes to '1' (or 'm').  Pettycoin
	  uses 56 (120 for testnet), which encodes to 'P' (or 'q').
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="transaction"><a href="#transaction">
	    What does a transaction look like?
	</a></h4>

	<p class="details">
	  A normal transaction has up to 4 inputs, which must be to the same
	  address, and two outputs: the amount being sent, and the implied
	  amount of change.  It's between 168 and 276 bytes long:
	</p>
	<pre class="details">
/* Core of a transaction */
struct protocol_tx_normal {
	u8 version;
	u8 type; /* == TX_NORMAL | PROTOCOL_FEE_TYPE */

	/* Number of inputs to spend (&lt;= PROTOCOL_TX_MAX_INPUTS) */
	le32 num_inputs;
	/* ECDSA of double SHA256 of above, and input[num_inputs] below. */
	struct protocol_signature signature;
};
	</pre>

	<p class="details">
	  The transaction is followed by details of the inputs:
	</p>
	<pre class="details">
struct protocol_input {
	/* This identifies the transaction. */
	struct protocol_double_sha input;
	/* This identifies the output.
	 * For normal transactions, 0 == send_amount, 1 = change */
	le16 output;
	le16 unused;
};
	</pre>
	<p class="details">
	  Other transaction types are as expected: TX_FROM_GATEWAY
	  doesn't have any inputs, just outputs.  TX_TO_GATEWAY
	  doesn't have any outputs (from a pettycoin point-of-view).
	  TX_CLAIM is a little special, and deserves its <a href="#miner-claims">own section</a>.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="shard"><a href="#shard">
	    What does a shard look like?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  Each transaction belongs in a shard: which shard depends on
	  the lower bits of the input address.  There are currently 4
	  shards, and a network vote can increase this in future up to
	  65536.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  The assumption is that you will choose your addresses to all
	  belong to the same shard, so you don't have to monitor the
	  entire network.

      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="block"><a href="#block">
	    What does a block look like?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  A block contains a header (nonce, previous block, address
	  for miner reward, some metadata), an array of sizes for each
	  shard, an array of merkle hashes for each shard, then
	  finally a bitcoin-compatible tailer (timestamp, difficulty,
	  32-bit nonce).
	<p class="details">
	  The merkle hash for each shard is a hashing together of
	  transactions similar
	  to <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#Merkle_Trees">
	    bitcoin</a>, with the notable variation that each
	  transaction is hashed together with the back-references for
	  each input, to tell you where they are in the blockchain:
	</p>
	<pre class="details">
struct protocol_input_ref {
	/* Follow -&gt;prev this many times. */

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="miners"><a href="#miners">
	    Why do miners need to know the whole network?
	</a></h4>

	<p class="details">
	  In the bitcoin network, a node will only accept a block when
	  it sees and checks the entire contents.  For pettycoin, we
	  rely on checking what we can, and ensuring that there's a
	  way to <a href="#complaints">concisely prove</a> any problem
	  we might find.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  But this only works if the contents of a block are widely
	  known, thus we require miners to hash the contents of some
	  previous blocks with their own output address (which will be
	  different for each miner).
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  Its assumed that miners will want to collect as many
	  transactions as they can, so this "full knowledge"
	  requirement isn't overly burdensome on them.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxed">
	<h4 id="horizon"><a href="#horizon">
	    What happens to old blocks?
	</a></h4>
	<p class="details">
	  A transaction in block B can't reference a transaction in
	  any block whose timestamp is more than 30 days behind B's
	  timestamp.  In future, this saves everyone storing all the
	  blocks in the history.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  Thus you can't spend old transactions.  The current gateway
	  will send them back to the same address(es) on the bitcoin
	  network.

	  transaction is the reward transaction for the previous 100
	  blocks.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  The miner issues a special TX_CLAIM transaction uses this
	  transaction (which must be at least 100 blocks old) as an
	  input, and has a single output, which can then be used in a
	  normal transaction.

	  Pettycoin uses a system of "complaint" packets, which

	  descendents) invalid.
	</p>
	<p class="details">
	  Each complaint contains the transaction(s) it is complaining
