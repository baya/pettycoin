The gateway (bitcoin -> pettycoin only!) is finished, and dumbwallet
is too.  So I pushed and tagged the release v-alpha01.

I announced on
[G+](https://plus.google.com/103188246877163594460/posts/CX6NXUPAi3p)
and my [personal blog](http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=432).  I also went
over to the bitcoin forum; but wasn't sure where to post it.  Ended up
on "other", and was recommended to go to
[altcoin announce](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0),
(despite not being an altcoin) where it promptly got lost in the
noise.

Plenty of things on my TODO list, but planning a light day tomorrow to
take stock and celebrate!
