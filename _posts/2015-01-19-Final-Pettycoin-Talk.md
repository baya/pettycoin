I spoke on pettycoin at linux.conf.au last week.  In practice, it's
80% an explanation of the bitcoin protocol and the sidechains proposal,
which I haven't seen covered in significant technical detail before.

It went quite well, and is a good primer for the bitcoin-curious who
want to understand the excitement around the sidechains paper.  It's
[available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq2EvH4eGLk).
