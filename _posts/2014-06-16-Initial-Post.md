Since my wonderful wife convinced me to take a [six month
sabbatical](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=419) I'll be posting the gory
details of my work on pettycoin here.  Four days of pettycoin hacking,
and one day of baby-wrangling and keeping up with my other
miscellaneous projects ([linux kernel maintenance](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rusty/linux.git/) and [virtio standards](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/virtio)).
