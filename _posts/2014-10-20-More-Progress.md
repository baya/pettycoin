After a three week holiday, I'm now caught up with my mail and backlog
of kernel work, and am finally back to pettycoin.

I posted
[an update](https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/pettycoin-dev/2014-October/000019.html)
to the pettycoin-dev mailing list; right now I'm chasing the disconnected peer
bug, so I can get back to the protocol changes I want for alpha03.
