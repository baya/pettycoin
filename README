This is an unstable, developer experiment!

Follow along the fun here: http://rustyrussell.github.io/pettycoin/

Pettycoin requires the following dependencies:

* openssl.h
* valgrind, used by unit testing

Thus, on a fresh Debian-based system you may need to do:

	# apt-get install build-essential git libssl-dev valgrind

Good luck!
Rusty.
